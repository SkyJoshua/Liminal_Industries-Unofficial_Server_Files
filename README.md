You may need to make your own world in singleplayer as sometimes the world doesnt generate properly.
---

How to do so:

1. Create a new world without changing any settings
2. Exit out of the world
3. (If you need to) Compress your world folder
4. Upload the world folder to the server
5. (If you need to) Uncompress the world folder
6. Rename the world folder to "world" (without the " ")

Make sure that the items inside the root folder arent in a subdirectry root folder,
inside the first world folder you should see quite a few files

(it should be something like root/world/20ish files/folders)
